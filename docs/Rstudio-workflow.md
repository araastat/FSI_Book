## Rstudio workflow {#workflow}

As we've seen, RStudio has both a scripting pane to write code, and a console pane to run code. Of course, you can write code directly into the console, but it is **not** a good practice. You will tend to get sloppy, lose the "story", and generally have less reproducible code. 

Writing the program ("story") is just more reliable if you write into the script file and the send it to the console to run. Sending it to the console can be acheieved with a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-Enter (or Cmd-Enter on a Mac). This is something that will be second nature while coding in RStudio.
