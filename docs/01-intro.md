# An Introduction to R

[R](https://www.r-project.org){target=_blank} is the 
most popular[^1] open source _statistical programming language_ in the world. It
allows you to 

1. read datasets written in a wide variety of formats, 
1. clean and process the data,
1. derive summaries, 
1. run analytics, 
1. visualize
1. create automated reports, presentations, websites, dashboards and interactive applications

R is not just a language, but an ecosystem comprising over 15,000 user- and corporation-developed
_packages_ or modules, all written in the R language for a variety of purposes. It is a very flexible and customizable language, which is why it is used by an estimated 2 million users worldwide for data analytics.
The question R users often ask is not "Can it be done?" but rather "How can it be done?". R is used
in areas as varied as healthcare, economics, forestry, oceanography, pharmaceuticals, artificial
intelligence and natural language processing. 

## A note on coding and programming {-}

R does not have a _point-and-click_ interface that you are probably more familiar with
from Excel, Word or other computer applications. It requires you to _code_, i.e. write
instructions for the computer to, in the case of R, read, analyze, graph and report on datasets. 

R is first and foremost a __language__. So, instead of thinking that this is some 
geeky thing that "programmers" and "IT people" do, think of it as learning a language. 
You will see that, like any language, it has nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, 
and you can create "sentences" that start with data and end in something useful like a 
table, graph or document. With a traditional spoken and written language like French, Arabic, Farsi or Japanese, you learn it to 
be able to interact with people at different posts around the world. With a programming language
like R, you will be able to interact with __data__, to make sense of it, to describe it,
and to present it.
