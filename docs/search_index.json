We will cover the entire data analytics pipeline from data ingestion to data wrangling, summarizing, modeling, visualizing and reporting, all using tools found within the R ecosystem. The version of these notes you are reading now was built on 2019-03-23. To raise an issue about the note’s content (e.g., code not running) or to make a feature request, check out the issue tracker. Reproducibility These notes are written with bookdown, a R package for writing books using rmarkdown. All code in these notes were developed on R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23), using the same packages pre-installed in your virtual machines. When you’re on your own, you will need to install a recent version of R, and also install the corresponding packages, on your computer, for all the code to work. A listing of all the packages used in this course will be available as an appendix. To build these notes locally, clone or download the Github repo hosting these notes, unzip it if necessary, and double-click on FSI_Book.Rproj. Assuming you have RStudio installed, this will open this project (more on RStudio Projects later). You can then go to the console and enter the following code: bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) # to build these notes browseURL(&quot;_book/index.html&quot;) # to view it "],
["an-introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 1 An Introduction to R A note on coding and programming", " Chapter 1 An Introduction to R R is the most popular1 open source statistical programming language in the world. It allows you to read datasets written in a wide variety of formats, clean and process the data, derive summaries, run analytics, visualize create automated reports, presentations, websites, dashboards and interactive applications R is not just a language, but an ecosystem comprising over 15,000 user- and corporation-developed packages or modules, all written in the R language for a variety of purposes. It is a very flexible and customizable language, which is why it is used by an estimated 2 million users worldwide for data analytics. The question R users often ask is not “Can it be done?” but rather “How can it be done?”. R is used in areas as varied as healthcare, economics, forestry, oceanography, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence and natural language processing. A note on coding and programming R does not have a point-and-click interface that you are probably more familiar with from Excel, Word or other computer applications. It requires you to code, i.e. write instructions for the computer to, in the case of R, read, analyze, graph and report on datasets. R is first and foremost a language. So, instead of thinking that this is some geeky thing that “programmers” and “IT people” do, think of it as learning a language. You will see that, like any language, it has nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, and you can create “sentences” that start with data and end in something useful like a table, graph or document. With a traditional spoken and written language like French, Arabic, Farsi or Japanese, you learn it to be able to interact with people at different posts around the world. With a programming language like R, you will be able to interact with data, to make sense of it, to describe it, and to present it. https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2018↩ "]
