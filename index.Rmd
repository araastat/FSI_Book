# Welcome {-}

This course is an introduction to the statistical programming language 
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and various applications. We will cover the entire data analytics pipeline from data ingestion to data wrangling, summarizing, modeling, visualizing and reporting, all using tools found within the R ecosystem

The version of these notes you are reading now was built on 
`r Sys.Date()`. To raise an issue about the note's content (e.g., code not running) or to make a feature request, check out the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/araastat/FSI_Book/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

These notes are written with [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org), a R package for writing books using [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
All code in these notes were developed on `r R.version$version.string`, using
the same packages pre-installed in your virtual machines. When you're on your
own, you will need to install a recent version of R, and also install the
corresponding packages, on your computer, for all the code to work. A listing of
all the packages used in this course will be available as an appendix.

To build these notes locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/araastat/FSI_Book/archive/master.zip) the 
[Github repo](https://github.com/araastat/FSI_Book) hosting these notes, unzip it if necessary, and double-click on `FSI_Book.Rproj`. Assuming you have RStudio installed, this will open this project (more on _RStudio Projects_ later). You can then go to the console and enter the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build these notes
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```
